This is a startup script for Helma written by Andreas Bolka. It allows 
you to automatically run Helma as a service on Linux and Unix hosts. 
It was originally written for Debian GNU/Linux, but was successfully 
tested on SuSE Linux and should work for most Linux and Unix platforms. 

If you are looking for a way to run Helma as Service on a Windows 
machine, have a look at HelmaService:

Windows or Unix box, please drop us a note on the Helma User Mailing
